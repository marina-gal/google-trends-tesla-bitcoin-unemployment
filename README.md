This project is part of the **"100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu (Udemy)** and was expanded to showcase practical **data analysis skills in Python**.
The analysis explores how public interest (Google Trends) relates to real-world indicators:
- Tesla stock price (TSLA)
- Bitcoin daily price (BTC)
- Bitcoin trend search
- U.S. unemployment rate

The analysis is implemented in Python using a **Jupyter Notebook**, with a focus on time series handling, data cleaning, resampling, and visual exploration.

The notebook includes the following main sections:
### 1. **Analyzing Google Trends**
Initial exploration of trends for Tesla, Bitcoin, and Unemployment.

### 2. **Exploring Tesla Search Trend vs Price**
Comparison between:
- Google search volume (Tesla)
- Tesla stock historical prices

### 3. **Exploring Unemployment Data**
Visualization and inspection of U.S. unemployment indicators.

### 4. **Exploring Bitcoin Data**
Includes:
- Bitcoin Google Trends search volume
- Daily Bitcoin price dataset

### 5. **Cleaning Data (Missing Values)**
Converting dates, handling nulls, and aligning datasets.

### 6. **Resampling for Comparability**
Using `.resample()` to match time scales:
- Monthly
- Daily (as needed)

### 7. **Visualizations**
Final comparable line charts:
- Tesla trend search vs price  
- Bitcoin trend search vs price  
- Unemployment trend search vs unemployment rate
- Rolling 6 Month average: Unemployment trend search vs unemployment rate

### 8. **Including 2020**
Analysis of the COVID-19 period and how search interest spiked for some indicators.
