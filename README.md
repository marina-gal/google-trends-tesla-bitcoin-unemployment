# Google Trends Analysis: Tesla, Bitcoin & Unemployment

This project is part of the **"100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu (Udemy)** and was expanded to showcase practical **data analysis skills in Python**.
The analysis explores how public interest (Google Trends) relates to real-world indicators:
- Tesla stock price (TSLA)
- Bitcoin daily price (BTC)
- Bitcoin trend search
- U.S. unemployment rate

The notebook includes the following main sections:

### 1. **Analyzing Google Trends**
Initial exploration of trends for Tesla, Bitcoin, and Unemployment.

### 2. **Exploring Tesla Search Trend vs Price**
Comparison between:
- Google search volume (Tesla)
- Tesla stock historical prices

### 3. **Exploring Unemployment Data**
Visualization and inspection of U.S. unemployment indicators.

### 4. **Exploring Bitcoin Data**
Includes:
- Bitcoin Google Trends search volume
- Daily Bitcoin price dataset

### 5. **Cleaning Data (Missing Values)**
Converting dates, handling nulls, and aligning datasets.

### 6. **Resampling for Comparability**
Using `.resample()` to match time scales:
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Daily (as needed)

### 7. **Visualizations**
Final comparable line charts:
- Tesla trend vs price  
- Bitcoin trend vs price  
- Unemployment trend vs unemployment rate  

### 8. **Including 2020**
Analysis of the COVID-19 period and how search interest spiked for some indicators.


The analysis is implemented in Python using a **Jupyter Notebook**, with a focus on time series handling, data cleaning, resampling, and visual exploration.

### Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Matplotlib.mdates

### Key Skills

- Time series manipulation  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Joining and aligning datasets of different frequencies  
- Visualization and exploratory data analysis  
- Understanding patterns between public search behavior and real economic indicators
