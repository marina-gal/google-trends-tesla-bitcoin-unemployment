# Google Trends Analysis: Tesla, Bitcoin & Unemployment

This project is part of the **"100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu (Udemy)** and was expanded to showcase practical **data analysis skills in Python**.
The analysis explores how public interest (Google Trends) relates to real-world indicators:
- Tesla stock price (TSLA)
- Bitcoin daily price (BTC)
