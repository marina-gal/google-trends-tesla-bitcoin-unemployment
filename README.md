# Google Trends Analysis: Tesla, Bitcoin & Unemployment

This project analyzes public interest in three major economic and financial topics — **Tesla**, **Bitcoin**, and **Unemployment** — using **Google Trends** data.  
The goal is to explore how search interest correlates with real-world indicators such as stock prices, cryptocurrency values, and unemployment rates over time.

The analysis is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on time series handling, data cleaning, resampling, and visual exploration.
